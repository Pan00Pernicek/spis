# Spis

text editor made in bash because insanity
TODO: config docs

## features
	syntax highlighting (currently for bash (and other posix like shells) and partially conf)
	file picker
	proper? tab handling
	custom keybindings (via arrays at start of script)
	custom top line menu (via above)
	custom colourscheme (also)
	mouse support -- absolute mess and works only if it deems you worthy of using it

## limitations
	speed, since i have no idea what i am doing, and inside of bash; it can be quite slow
		especially slow it will be while opening big files with supported syntax highlighting, since highlighting function currently is really slow
	*and everything else i did not implement yet*
